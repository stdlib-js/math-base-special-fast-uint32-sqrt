    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/math-base-special-fast-uint32-sqrt
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm` branch][esm-url].
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno` branch][deno-url].
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd` branch][umd-url].

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var sqrtUint32 = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-fast-uint32-sqrt' );
```

#### sqrtUint32( x )

Returns an **approximate** [square root][square-root] of an unsigned 32-bit integer `x`.

```javascript
var v = sqrtUint32( 9 >>> 0 );
// returns 3

v = sqrtUint32( 2 >>> 0 );
// returns 1

v = sqrtUint32( 3 >>> 0 );
// returns 1

v = sqrtUint32( 0 >>> 0 );
// returns 0
```

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   Prefer hardware `sqrt` over a software implementation.
-   When using a software `sqrt`, this implementation provides a performance boost when an application requires only **approximate** computations for integer arguments.
-   For applications requiring high-precision, this implementation is **never** suitable.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var sqrtUint32 = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-fast-uint32-sqrt' );

var v;
var i;

for ( i = 0; i < 101; i++ ) {
    v = sqrtUint32( i >>> 0 );
    console.log( 'sqrt(%d) â‰ˆ %d', i, v );
}
